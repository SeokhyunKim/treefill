NetLogo simulation code for the paper "An optimal distributed trigger counting algorithm for large-scale networked systems".

## How to run
* You need NetLogo to open .nlogo simulation file and run it.
  * Please check, https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/
* After installing NetLogo, just double click nlogo file. For detailed algorithm and parameter of the simulation, please refer the paper.
* Simulation code was written with NetLogo5. But I checked the files are opened and running with NetLogo6 also in Mac OS X.
